# SolarSizerCalculator

A web application to help users calculate the optimal size and number of solar panels based on daily energy consumption and location.

## Project Overview

Solar Sizer Calculator is an intuitive tool designed to help homeowners and solar enthusiasts determine the optimal size and number of solar panels required based on their daily energy consumption and location. By entering essential data such as energy usage, solar panel wattage, and average sunlight hours, users can quickly estimate their solar requirements and make informed decisions about their solar energy investments. The application aims to promote sustainable energy solutions and empower users to optimize their solar power systems efficiently.

## Key Features

### User Inputs

- __Daily Energy Consumption__: Users input the average daily energy usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh), derived from a list of household appliances.
- __Appliance Details__: For each appliance, users provide:
> - Power Rating: The wattage of the appliance (e.g., 1500W).
> - Usage Hours: The average daily hours the appliance is used.
> - Number of Units: The quantity of that appliance in the household.
> - Category: Classification of the appliance (e.g., heating, cooling, lighting, etc.).
- __Solar Panel Output__: The wattage of a single solar panel (e.g., 300W).
- __Average Sunlight Hours__: The average number of peak sunlight hours per day in the userâ€™s location.

### Calculation Logic

- The application retrieves the appliance data and user inputs.
- It calculates the daily energy consumption based on the appliance details.
- It determines the solar panel output using the provided data.
- It calculates the number of panels needed by dividing the daily energy consumption by the panel output.

### Settings Configuration

- Users can configure their energy cost rating (e.g., $0.12 per kWh), currency preferences, dark mode toggle, and location settings.
- The app uses the location to obtain peak sunlight hours through a third-party API, ensuring accurate solar panel power production calculations.

## Output Display

- The results are presented clearly, showing:
> - The total wattage required.
> - The number of solar panels needed.
> - Additional information such as total system size, potential energy production, and estimated cost savings based on the configured energy cost rating.
